# Data folder

This folder contains all data used and generated in the project, including raw data, sample data, and derived datasets.  
Due to participant privacy and data protection considerations, not all data contained in this folder is publicly shared.

## Folder overview

### 1_raw_data/ (ignored)
This folder contains the pre-test and post-test raw data from all participant groups who took part in the study (auditory training group, visual training group, no training group) **N=75**.  
These files are **not included in the repository** due to ethical and privacy considerations.

---

### 1_raw_data_sample/ (tracked)
This folder contains a small subset of anonymized raw data files provided as examples.  
The sample data can be used to:
- run the preprocessing pipeline,
- understand the structure of the raw data,
- verify that the preprocessing code works as intended.

---

### 2_preprocessed_data/ (ignored, generated)
This folder contains preprocessed data files generated from the raw data.

- **Generated by:**  
  `pre-post_experiment/raw_to_preprocessed/convert_csv_PrePost.py`
- **Input:**  
  `1_raw_data/` or `1_raw_data_sample/`
- **Output:**  
  Preprocessed data files used for subsequent analyses

This folder is **not included in the repository**, but parts of it can be recreated by running the preprocessing script on `1_raw_data_sample/`.

> **Note:**  
> The `2_preprocessed_data/` folder must exist inside `data/` before running the preprocessing script. The script will populate the folder with output files.
> To generate these files using the code provided change `1_raw_data` to `1_raw_data_sample` in the code.

### 3_json_files/ (ignored, generated)
This folder contains JSON files generated from the preprocessed data.

- **Generated by:**  
  `pre-post_experiment/preprocessed_to_xlsx/main_prepostExp.js`
- **Input:**  
  `2_preprocessed_data/`
- **Output:**  
  JSON files used for downstream analyses and visualizations

This folder is **not included in the repository**, but can be recreated by running the conversion script.

> **Note:**  
> The `3_json_files/` folder must exist inside `data/` before running the conversion script. The script will populate the folder with output files.

### EndofStudyQuestionnaire_Pretest_64participants.xlsx (ignored)
### EndofStudyQuestionnaire_Posttest_64participants.xlsx (ignored)
The questionnaire dataset collected from the final sample of 64 participants. This file is **not publicly shared** due to privacy considerations.  
- The `EndofStudyQuestionnaire_Pretest_64participants.xlsx` includes demographic, music-related and experiment-related questions.
- The `EndofStudyQuestionnaire_Posttest_64participants.xlsx` includes experiment-related questions only.
Derived variables used in the analyses are included in the preprocessed datasets.

- **Input:**
  `EndofStudyQuestionnaire_Pretest_64participants.xlsx` 
  `EndofStudyQuestionnaire_Posttest_64participants.xlsx`

- **analysis:**
  `survey_analysis/Qualtrics inf_analysis_pretest.py`
  `survey_analysis/Qualtrics inf_analysis_posttest.py`

- **Output:**
  `results/end_of_study_questionnaire_pretest.xlsx`
  `results/end_of_study_questionnaire_posttest.xlsx`

> **Note:**
> To generate these files using the code provided change `EndofStudyQuestionnaire_Pretest_64participants.xlsx` to `EndofStudyQuestionnaire_Pretest_sample.xlsx` in the code.

---

### EndofStudyQuestionnaire_Pretest_sample.xlsx (tracked)

This file is a **sample version** of the pre-test end-of-study questionnaire data containing **synthetic (fake) responses** from four participants.

- The structure (column names and data format) matches the original Qualtrics export.
- The file is provided to allow users to run and inspect the questionnaire analysis pipeline.
