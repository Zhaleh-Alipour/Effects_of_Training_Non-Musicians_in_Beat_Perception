# raw_to_preprocessed

This folder contains the script `convert_csv_VisTraining.py` for preprocessing raw experimental data exported from PsychoPy.  
The preprocessing focuses on **removing unnecessary columns**, **renaming retained columns for clarity**, and **exporting cleaned data** in a format suitable for analysis.

---

## Overview

The preprocessing script reads raw `.csv` files generated by the experiment, selects only the relevant columns, renames them using a predefined mapping, and saves the cleaned output as **Excel (`.xlsx`) files**.

Each participant’s data is processed and saved as a **separate Excel file**, facilitating downstream analysis.

## Input and Output

### Input
- Raw `.csv` files located in: 
    - `data/1_raw_data/`
> **Note:** Replace `1_raw_data` with `1_raw_data_sample` if you want to run the code because the complete raw data is ignored!

### Output
- Preprocessed `.xlsx` files saved in:
    - `data/2_preprocessed_data/`

> **Note:** The `2_preprocessed_data` folder must be created manually before running the preprocessing script.
