# Data Folder

This folder contains all data used and generated throughout the project, including raw data, sample data, and derived datasets.  
Due to participant privacy and data protection requirements, **not all data in this folder are publicly shared**.

## Folder Overview

### `1_raw_data/` **(ignored)**

This folder contains the raw data from all participants in the auditory training groups (**N = 25**).  
The files include responses exclusively from the **visual beat sequence training block**, as it was the trainig material.

Key columns include:
- `NumberOfIntervals`: visual stimuli presented in each trial  
- `Diff`: correct response for each trial  
- `key_resp_5.keys`: participant response for each trial  

Participants in the first visual training group are identified by **`vistrain1`** in the file name, while participants in the second group are identified by **`vistrain2`**.

> **Note:**  
> These files are **not included in the repository** due to ethical and participant privacy considerations.

### `1_raw_data_sample/` **(tracked)**

This folder contains a small subset of **anonymized raw data files** provided as examples.  
The sample data can be used to:
- Run the preprocessing pipeline  
- Understand the structure and format of the raw data  
- Verify that the preprocessing scripts function as intended  

---

### `2_preprocessed_data/` **(ignored, generated)**

This folder contains preprocessed data files generated from the raw data.

Key columns include:
- `VisReg`: the three auditory stimuli presented in each trial  
- `VisRegDiff`: the correct response  
- `VisRegResp`: participant response  

- **Generated by:** `visual_training/raw_to_preprocessed/convert_csv_VisTraining.py`  
- **Input:** `1_raw_data/` or `1_raw_data_sample/`  
- **Output:** Preprocessed data files used for subsequent analyses  

This folder is **not included in the repository**, but it can be partially recreated by running the preprocessing script on `1_raw_data_sample/`.

> **Note:**  
> - The `2_preprocessed_data/` folder must exist inside `data/` before running the preprocessing script.  
> - The script will populate the folder with output files.  
> - To generate these files using the provided sample data, replace `1_raw_data/` with `1_raw_data_sample/` in the script.

### `3_json_files/` **(ignored, generated)**

This folder contains JSON files generated from the preprocessed data.

- **Generated by:** `visual_training/preprocessed_to_xlsx/main_vistraining.js`  
- **Input:** `2_preprocessed_data/`  
- **Output:** JSON files used for downstream analyses and visualizations  

This folder is **not included in the repository**, but it can be recreated by running the conversion script.

> **Note:**  
> The `3_json_files/` folder must exist inside `data/` before running the conversion script. The script will populate the folder with output files.
